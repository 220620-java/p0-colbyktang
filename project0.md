# Project 0
For Project 0, I will be building a console-based application that will be presented on Wednesday, July 6, 2022.

## Course Registration Application Details 

### User Stories

As any kind of user, I can:
- [ ] login with my existing credentials

As a faculty member I can:
- [ ] add new classes to the registration catalog
- [ ] change the registration details for a class
- [ ] remove a class from the registration catalog (this should unregister all registered students)

As a student, I can:
- [ ] register a new account with the system (must be secured with a password)
- [ ] view classes available for registration
- [ ] register for an open and available class
- [ ] cancel my registration for a class (if within window)
- [ ] view the classes that I have registered for

## Minimum Features

All project concepts must display the following domain-independent features/requirements:
 
- [ ] Use of custom data structures (do not use java.util Collection types!)
- [ ] Basic validation of user input (e.g. no registration for classes outside of registration window, no negative deposits/withdrawals, no overdrafting, etc.) 
- [ ] Unit tests for all business-logic classes
- [ ] All exceptions are properly caught and handled
- [ ] Proper use of OOP principles
- [ ] Documentation (all classes and methods have basic documentation)
- [ ] Database is 3rd Normal Form Compliant
- [ ] Referential integrity (e.g. if a class is removed from the catalog, no students should be registered for it)
- [ ] Logging messages and exceptions to a file using a custom logger
- [ ] Generation of basic design documents (e.g. relational diagram, class diagram, flows, etc.)


## Tech Stack

Regardless of the project concept you choose, you will be required to adhere to the following tech stack:

- [ ] Java 8
- [ ] Apache Maven
- [ ] PostgreSQL (hosted on AWS RDS)
- [ ] Git SCM (hosted on GitHub)


## Repo Instructions
- Create a new repository using the GitHub classroom link.
- Keep this repository up to date with frequent commits and pushes (follow best practices!)
- It is recommended (though not required) that you implement some kind of branching strategy when implementing new features into your application

## Presentation
- [ ] finalized version of application must be pushed to personal repository within this organization by the presentation date
- [ ] 5 minute live demonstration of the implemented features
