# Project 0: Course Registration Application
## Description
A console-based course registration application that will allow students and faculty members to manage courses.

Students will be able to register a new account, view classes available for registration, register for classes, cancel class registrations, and view enrolled classes.

Faculty members can add new classes, change class details, and remove a class.

Students, faculty members, and courses will be stored on a RDS hosted by Amazon Web Services so internet is required.

## Tech Stack
- Java 8
- Apache Maven
- PostgreSQL (hosted on AWS RDS)
- Git SCM (hosted on GitHub)
